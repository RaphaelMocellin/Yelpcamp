# Yelpcamp

Yealpcamp is a copy of a famous web app called yelp. I gave it a twist and made it specific for camp sites.
I've made it using pure javascpit, not frameworks envolved. It was my first project and i felt i needed to do something with the skills i just learned. Its main goal was to pratice Javascript, nodeJS, Express and MongoDB.
This was my first real project and I'm pretty confident of what I've accomplished using RESTful Routes, mongoose as well as several npm packages.

Some challenging (and also frustrating!) moments were overcome, in particular:

- Implementation of authentication and authorization
- Implementation of a map cluster using Mapbox
- Handling of errors, cookies and session


Anyways, every time I look at this project I see countless possibilities to implement new features.
I found the current state acceptable and took the opportunity to put it in my portfolio.
